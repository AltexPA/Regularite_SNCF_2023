# Regularite_SNCF_2023
This is a simple data project made in my free time about the trains statistic of the SNCF up to 2023. It contains a notebook made with Jupyter containing all I could think of 
to have the best conclusion about which metrics impact the most the SNCF train network.

I will improve the quality of this notebook with time. Since this is the first commit, it lacks deeper insight.
